# Queuing_Systems
Simulation of Queuing Systems-M/M/1 and M/D/1

In this project the goal was to get comfortable with data structures and more specifically, to build a simulation of the queuing systems M/M/1 and Îœ/D/1 with the use of a queue, which was implemented with a linked list. The languge used was C.

We created the 2 models and then we compared the results of the program with the results of the theoritical models.
